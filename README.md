# ðŸŒ± Botany Management System

This is an IoT project with 3 main components:
- **IoT**: Data logging devices that are designed to harvest various types of readings and other media. Currently this is designed around small microcomputers like a rasberry pi, but anything that is capable of internet access will do. 
- **API**: A backend API for serving configuration metadata to the IoT devices, along with providing data for the web UI. The API will support a variety of features such as analytics, task automation, etc. 
- **Web UI**: Angular based web UI provides easy access to data, media, and configuration. 

Currently this is a small pet project of mine to implement a dynamic and modular IoT system with "smart" features. I will hopefully use this as a basis for IoT security research, along with helping me take better care of my plants. Stay tuned for upcoming releases!
